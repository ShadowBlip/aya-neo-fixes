Various fixes for the Aya Neo family of handheld consoles in Linux using systemd.

- Enables use of extra buttons on the controller. (depends on python-evdev)

## Add New Device to neo-controller service
Please open a bug in [issues](https://github.com/ShadowBlip/aya-neo-fixes/issues).

There are two methods of provding the data.

### Option 1: capture-system.py (preferred)
- Run ```sudo python capture-system.py``` from the git clone directory and upload the generated file to your issue, along with any other pertinant information.

### Option 2: Manual Data Capture

Post the following information to your github issue:
- Output of ```cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name```
- Output of ```cat /proc/bus/input/devices```

I will also need you to install and run the ```evtest``` package per your distro package management. In most cases, unsupported buttons are attached to the ```AT Translated Set 2 keyboard``` device. Match the event# of that device when running as root. Provide the output of evtest for each button. Please label each button and corresponding keycode. I.E.:
```
Small button:

Event: time 1652292081.491162, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 125 (KEY_LEFTMETA), value 1
